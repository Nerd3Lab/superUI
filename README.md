## About SuperUI

🚀 The Ultimate Ethereum & Superchain Development Playground

### Introduction
SuperUI is an UI for Supersim that can simulate and run local chain or fork chain designed to make building on Superchain easier. We provide a user-friendly interface for testing, simulating, and debugging OP Stack applications. With SuperUI, you can fork networks, deploy smart contracts, and inspect chain state—all without relying solely on CLI commands. Our goal is to simplify the development process and support builders in creating seamless Superchain applications.
